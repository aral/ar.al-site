There is a lot of confusion on behalf of those who benefit from there being confusion on such matters about what exactly privacy means.

“It’s complicated,” we are told.

“It requires nuance.”

“It means different things to different people…”

Bullshit.

The Merriam-Webster Dictionary [defines privacy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/privacy) as follows:

> a: the quality or state of being apart from company or observation : seclusion

> b: freedom from unauthorized intrusion

Across the pond, the Oxford English Dictionary [defines it](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/privacy) as:

> 1: A state in which one is not observed or disturbed by other people.
>
> 1.1:  The state of being free from public attention.

With all due to respect to Messrs. Merriam and Mr. Webster, as well as to those lovable[^1] toffs up at Oxford, I prefer my own definition: 

> Privacy is the right to choose what you keep to yourself and what you share with others.

Whether or not you have privacy comes down to a very simple binary: are you or are you not in a place where you can make the choice to not share.

### Intrinsic privacy vs extrinsic privacy in physical/biological space

In the pre-computer, pre-digital, pre-network world, we could make the following assumptions about privacy in the physical space we inhabited with our biological forms:

  1. Intrinsic privacy, the privacy of your thoughts and feelings, is absolute.

  2. Extrinsic privacy, the privacy of your actions and behaviour, is pursuant on the ownership, control, integrity, and security of your environment.

#### Intrinsic privacy in physical/biological space

The absolute nature of intrinsic privacy in physical/biological space has historically held true due to two factors:

  1. That people[^2], by virtue of their being people and not property, have ownership and control of themselves.

  2. It has historically been technically infeasible to violate the integrity of the biological self in a manner that would directly divulge its intellectual and emotional inner state; in other words, the thoughts and feelings of a person[^3].

### Extrinsic privacy in physical/biological space 

In tangible space[^2], every place we inhabit with our physical being is owned and controlled by some entity. This might be an individual, a corporation (or some other organisation), the state, or the commons[^3]. Of the above, it is only in those places owned and controlled by individuals that those individuals have privacy. Unless, of course, the integrity of those spaces hasn’t already been compromised by third-party surveillance and as long as that integrity isn’t compromised in the future due to security lapses.

The nucleus of the ...

In such a space, the parents – who own and control the home – generally enjoy full privacy (and if one of the parents compromises the privacy of the other, it is seen as abusive behaviour). Their children, on the other hand, inhabit a space that they do not own or control. It follows that they have as little or as much privacy as their parents allow. Sadly, this usually ranges from no privacy whatsoever, to levels of privacy that would be seen as abusive if provided by one adult to another in an everyday relationship.

We can see this parent/child relationship mirrored between a corporation and individuals in corporate-owned spaces and between the state and individuals in state-owned spaces.  


### Analog privacy vs digital privacy

In the analog world[^2], ...


If the default state of your existence in that place is public (in other words, you are under surveillance), then, by definition, you have no privacy.

In the digital/networked realm, if you are in a place owned and controlled by someone else, you have no privacy. You are robbed of the fundamental choice that defines privacy: everything you do is automatically shared with someone else. In this case, the owner of the place you inhabit.

So when you are on Facebook’s web site or in Facebook’s app, everything you do is shared with Facebook, Inc. by default. You have zero privacy. You have (illusion of) privacy switches where you can set which other Facebook users you want to share with but there is no switch that says “do not share with Facebook, Inc.”

The only way to guarantee privacy is to guarantee that you will have the fundamental choice that defines what privacy is at the most granular level conceivable[^2].  

Once the original decision is made and a thing is made public, it is public. A thing that is public cannot be made private again by any meaningful definition of the word. This is why whether or not the Original Decision exists is the only meaningful criterion of whether or not you have privacy.

It follows, then, that if you inhabit a place that is public by default, you do not have privacy because you are deprived of the right to make the Original Decision. 

In order to exercise your right to privacy, you must, by default, inhabit a private[^2] space.

That’s why you have no privacy on the platforms of people farmers like Facebook, Google, and the countless venture-capital-funded startups that form the long tail of surveillance capitalism. Everything you do on these platforms is shared with another entity: the corporation that owns and controls the platform.

Everything you do on Facebook is public because nothing you do on Facebook can be kept private from Facebook, Inc.

 If you are in a public space 


[^1]: Not lovable.

[^2]: It is worth noting that the notion that human beings are de facto people is a modern one. For most of history, most of humanity has – to one degree or other – been regarded as property. Privacy is a right that applies to people, not property. In those jurisdictions that people are regarded as property, any discussion of privacy is moot until the core injustice of the lack of personhood is rectified.  

[^3]: While this may sound like the very definition of torture, it is not. The key word here is “directly”. Torture is the violation of the integrity (and/or dignity) of the biological self in a manner that __indirectly__ divulges the intellectual and emotional state of a person. What I’m talking about here is the technical infeasibility, historically, of directly reading the mind of another; traversing their memories, feeling their emotions, seeing what they see, and hearing what they hear.

[^2]: The organic and inorganic context that we inhabit with our physical bodies.

[^3]: I make a distinction between the state and the commons – although in some left-leaning circles this is wilfully conflated – as it is both possible to have a state without a commons as it is a commons without a state.  

[^2]: At the human level, this might be a thought or an impetus as expressed by the smallest unit of action, whether the utterance of a 

[^2]: I mean “private as in privacy”, not “private as in property”. What is it with the English language when it comes to conflating the meaning of words that are fundamental to human rights with words that are fundamental to capitalism? Free means both “free as in freedom” and “free as in cost”. Private means both “private as in privacy”, and “private as in private property”. I wonder which came first: is our language messed up because we are messed up when it comes to these topics or are we messed up because our language is messed up?
