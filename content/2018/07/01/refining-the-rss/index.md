I realised today[^1] that my site‚Äôs feed wasn‚Äôt displaying well on the [RSS](/2018/06/29/reclaiming-rss/) reader I‚Äôm using ([Leaf](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/leaf-rss-news-reader/id576338668) on macOS). Some other feeds had image previews for items as well as an icon for the site itself while mine didn‚Äôt.

How utterly unacceptable!

### Sweat the small stuff (it‚Äôs all small stuff)

Given I‚Äôm writing this at almost 2AM on a Saturday night, you can probably deduce that there was a level of ‚Äì ahem ‚Äì _trial and error_ involved in getting things to work.

Initially, I thought the icon for my site wasn‚Äôt showing up because I hadn‚Äôt added an `<image>` tag to my RSS feed. So I added that to my RSS template in Hugo:

{{< highlight xml >}}
<rss version="2.0" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
  <channel>
    ‚Ä¶
    <image>
      <url>{{ "/apple-touch-icon-144x144.png" | absURL }}</url>
      <title>{{ if eq  .Title  .Site.Title }}{{ .Site.Title }}{{ else }}{{ with .Title }}{{.}} on {{ end }}{{ .Site.Title }}{{ end }}</title>
      <link>{{ .Permalink }}</link>
      <width>144</width>
      <height>144</height>
    </image>
    ‚Ä¶
  </channel>
</rss>
{{< /highlight >}}

Sadly, Leaf didn‚Äôt bite.

Images were working for [Laura‚Äôs site](https://laurakalbag.com) so I took a look at [her feed](https://laurakalbag.com/index.xml) and found a clue: her images had absolute URLs while mine were relative.

Hmm‚Ä¶ ü§î

### Relatively speaking

I can‚Äôt use absolute URLs on this site as it‚Äôs [a Web+ site](https://ar.al/2018/06/26/web+/). Since its accessible over both old school HTTPS and on the peer web, I can‚Äôt hardcode a protocol like `https://` as that would break links for the `dat://` protocol.

That limitation doesn‚Äôt really apply to the site‚Äôs RSS feed, however.

The [W3C Feed Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/feed) actually warns you _not_ to use relative URLs in your feeds. (This is a limitation I feel we should remove, going forward. Not least of all because peer replication of RSS feeds over DAT might have some interesting use cases for push/streaming syndication.)

So to cut to the chase, I decided to use a regular expression to massage the URLs in my RSS feed template in Hugo to convert relative URLs to absolute ones:

{{< highlight xml >}}
<item>
  ‚Ä¶
  <description>{{ replaceRE "img src=\"(.*?)\"" (printf "%s%s%s" "img src=\"" .Permalink "$1\"") .Content | html }}</description>
</item>
{{< /highlight >}}

Initially, I also had a negative lookahead in there to ensure I wouldn‚Äôt rewrite any URLs that might have been absolute URLs to begin:

{{< highlight js >}}
img src="(((?!http?).)*?)"
{{< /highlight >}}

But, sadly, [Go‚Äôs regular expression engine does not support negative lookaheads](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26771592/negative-look-ahead-go-regular-expressions#26792316). This isn‚Äôt a big deal, really, since it‚Äôs not good form to link to external images directly anyway.

With that change, image previews started working in Leaf.

### Favicon blues

But my site‚Äôs icon still wasn‚Äôt showing up.

It was one-something-AM and instead of going to bed like a sensible person, I decided that this needed fixing right now (the sadder part is that I‚Äôm writing this sentence while editing this post at 2:30AM).

Anyway, looking at an icon for site that was displaying properly, I noticed that the image was rather high resolution. So it wasn‚Äôt just grabbing a _favicon.ico_. I already had the ridiculous number of icons one needs for a respectable web site in 2018 generated using [Favic-O-Matic](http://www.favicomatic.com). In the end, after more trial and error, I found that Leaf was looking for an _apple-touch-icon.png_ file in the root of the site.

Adding that fixed the icon issue also.

### My kingdom for standards-compliant RSS readers

It would be ridiculous, of course, to try and support the idiosyncrasies of every RSS reader out there but I can at least make my feed look good on the one(s) I use. 

That said, it would also be great if more RSS readers supported standard elements when available.

Leaf, for example, should make use of the image tag if one exists in a feed. Similarly, RSS readers should present items in `enclosure` elements (images, audio, and video) when possible. While not part of the standard, it also wouldn‚Äôt take much work to resolve relative URLs properly in feeds either.
