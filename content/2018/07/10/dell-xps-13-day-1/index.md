title: "DOS to Windows to Mac to Linux: the story of half a lifetime in computing platforms"

I was gifted my first computer by my dad when I was seven years old. The year was 1983 and the machine was an IBM XT Compatible running DOS. It had 640KB of RAM and a 4-colour CGA screen. It also came with a BASIC manual. That computer and that manual sparked my lifelong fascination with technology.

This was the 80s and I was a cute little straight blonde kid that passed as white, growing up in Malaysia. I was spoiled. I was a brat. Computers were fascninating devices that gave me immense pleasure. I loved to tinker and explore. It was purely hedonistic. I also loved the praise from the adults in the room when they saw the games I made for myself. If I'd known the word back then, I would have described myself as a hedonist. I probably would have also made a good right libertarian. Anyway, you get the idea. 

I am also rather stubborn.[^1] This meant that I spent the next 23 years on Microsoft's platforms: first DOS, then Windows. I remember thinking how much potential there was in general purpose computing and in the promise of a platform that wasn't locked in to a single supplier. I remember thinking, one day we'll show those smug muffins that had Amigas how wrong they were (the Amiga, in retrospect, was lightyears ahead of its time and we all secretly envied it). But, of course, Microsoft was Microsoft. By 2006, it had been blatantly clear for years that Microsoft had failed to make the transition from the age of features to the age of experiences. Finally, in August of 2006, [I got my first Mac](https://2018.ar.al/681/).

This was about the time that I was really beginning to become aware of and understand the responsibility we had as makers to respect the time, effort, and experiences of the people who use the things we make. It would take more years before I could [articulate that with confidence](http://www.breakingthin.gs/this-is-all-there-is.html).

My switch to a Mac did not involve any sacrifices. It was seamless, thanks to a number of cross-platform tools and services like Parallels, IMAP, web services, and free and open source cross-platform apps. As I [wrote](ttps://2018.ar.al/681/) back then: "I still can't believe that I've basically switched to a different platform in less than a day. And by switched, I mean that I am up and running and being nearly as productive as I was on my PC."

In other words, there was a convenient bridge for me to walk over; I didn't have to brave the rough seas to get to the other side. It's no coincidence that I only felt confident to make the switch after Apple moved to using Intel processors. Also, it would have been much harder to do so if I hadn't already made a concscious decision to wean myself away from Microsoft's lock-in by moving to free and open and cross-platform tools earlier. Folks working in freedom technology and decentralisation would be remiss to ignore the importance of such bridges. Both the centralised world and the decentralised worlds exist today as separate islands. Bridges are exactly what we need to be building today to get people from the former to the latter.




[^1]: I don't know whether this is a good thing or not. Iguess, like any other characteristic, it depends on what use it's put to. I like to think I've been learning to put it to better use over time, as I evolve and grow as a human being.

When it comes to the topic of computer platforms, being stubborn means that I spent way too much in Microsoft's walled garden and
