There’s a new version of [Gnomit](https://flathub.org/apps/details/ind.ie.Gnomit) out[^1] thanks to [the initiative](https://mastodon.technology/@bugaevc/100737595071420219) of [Sergey Bugaev](https://mastodon.technology/@bugaevc), who sent me [a patch](https://gitlab.gnome.org/snippets/341) that updated Gnomit’s window to use a standard window (instead of the dialog window I was using) and moved the Cancel and Commit buttons to its header bar.[^2]

The new look actually makes it mirror its inspiration, the Komet app on macOS, almost exactly.

Thank you for the patch, Sergey :)

You can install Gnomit via [Gnome Software](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Software) and [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/ind.ie.Gnomit).

The source code is available from [source.ind.ie](ttps://source.ind.ie/gnome/gnomit) and there’s also [a GitHub mirror](https://github.com/indie-mirror/gnomit) where you can open issues and submit pull requests.

[^1]: It might take a little time to propagate to Flathub’s web site and to Gnome Software.

[^2]: Sergey actually sent me the patch quite a few weeks ago but first [the new release of Better](http://localhost:1313/2018/09/25/better-blocker-thank-you-for-our-best-week-yet/) and then my XPS 13’s battery dying meant I only got round to taking a look at it now.
