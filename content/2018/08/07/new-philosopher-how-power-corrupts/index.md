Reading the latest issue of New Philosopher magazine, theme: how power corrupts, I was reminded of this quote by Michel Foucault that I love and which beautifully explain how I feel about what I do also:

> All my books… are – if you like – little toolboxes. If you want to open them, and use this or that sentence, this or that idea or analysis as a screwdriver or wrench to short-circuit, dismantle, or explode the systems of power… all right, all the better.
