### 6AM

I'm on a plane at silly o'clock en route to Denmark via London [to speak at Smukfest tomorrow](https://www.smukfest.dk/musik/kunstnere/verden-ifoelge-vaerten-overvaagningskapitalisme-er-vejen-til-helvede-brolagt-med-likes) near [Skanderborg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanderborg).

Landed at London Stansted airport and preparing to wait a couple of hours with three magazines ([Linux Magazine](https://www.linux-magazine.com/), [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/), and [New Philosopher](http://newphilosopher.com/))[^1], a lovely organic cappuccino, a lemon, lime, and ginger concoction of some persuasion, and an avocado and halloumi muffin.
