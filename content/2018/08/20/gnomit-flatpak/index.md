[Gnomit](https://source.ind.ie/gnome/gnomit/gjs), my simple Git commit message editor for Gnome,[^1] is now available as a [Flatpak](https://www.flatpak.org/) bundle.

To get started, see the [installation instructions.](https://source.ind.ie/gnome/gnomit/gjs#installation)

Please note that the Flatpak version is currently slower to launch than [running the GJS script directly](https://source.ind.ie/gnome/gnomit/gjs/tree/bare). For more information, see [known issues](https://source.ind.ie/gnome/gnomit/gjs#known-issues).

I hope to make the installation process simpler by submitting Gnomit to [Flathub](https://flathub.org/home) and I eventually want to host a Flatpak repository at [Ind.ie](https://ind.ie).

If you notice any issues, [please let me know](https://mastodon.ar.al).
