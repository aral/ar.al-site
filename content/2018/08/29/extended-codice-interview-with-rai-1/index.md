I was recently featured in [an episode](https://www.raiplay.it/video/2018/07/Codice-La-vita-e-digitale-Superuomini-o-postumani-9dddbdec-b750-449b-addd-3e3d08285bad.html)[^1] of a technology show called [Codice](https://www.raiplay.it/programmi/codicelavitaedigitale/) on Italian national television channel Rai 1. I just stumbled on an extended cut they released on surveillance-based video site YouTube. You can watch the segment here without being tracked.

[^1]: Registration is required to watch the original show (it is in Italian and my segments are dubbed).
