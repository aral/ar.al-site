[Better Blocker for iOS 12](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/better-blocker/id1080964978) is now available on the App Store.

[Better Blocker](https://better.fyi) is our content blocker for iOS and [macOS](http://localhost:1313/2018/09/24/better-blocker-for-macos-mojave/) that protects you from privacy-eroding surveillance-based behavioural advertising (adtech) and other trackers. It also removes ads that negatively impact your Web experience.[^1]

This release is a major redesign. Weâ€™ve worked hard to radically simplify the app.

See [Better, simpler, and more affordable](/2018/09/14/better-simpler-and-more-affordable/) and [Better Blocker: two year review and thoughts on the future](/2018/08/27/better-blocker-two-year-review-and-thoughts-on-the-future/) for more details on the release itself and our roadmap for Better in general.

I hope you enjoy the new iOS app![^2]

[^2]: As this is not a separate app but an update, if you previously bought Better on iOS, all you need to do is to update the app from the App Store. Please also tell your friends about Better and help support our work at [Ind.ie](https://ind.ie).
