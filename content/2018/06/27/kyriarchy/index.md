I learned a new word today: [Kyriarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy).

I found it in Diana’s [hugely inspirational initial post](https://garbados.github.io/my-blog/lets-begin.html) on [her new blog](https://garbados.github.io/my-blog/index.html) and immediately realised it was the word I was struggling for all those times that “patriarchy” just wasn’t cutting the intersectional mustard in conversation.

According to Wikipedia, Kyriarchy is:

> a social system or set of connecting social systems built around domination, oppression, and submission. The word was coined by [Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Schüssler_Fiorenza) in 1992 to describe her theory of interconnected, interacting, and self-extending systems of domination and submission, in which a single individual might be oppressed in some relationships and privileged in others. It is an intersectional extension of the idea of patriarchy beyond gender.

[Everyday Feminism magazine](https://everydayfeminism.com) has [a comic by Josette Souza](https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/03/slay-the-kyriarchy/) that explains it visually.

And in [Diana’s words](https://garbados.github.io/my-blog/lets-begin.html):

> I am more resolved than ever that we will end the kyriarchy. No one needs to starve or freeze or die. We can all live without fear.

Here’s to that.
