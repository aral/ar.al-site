Katja, Laura, Todd and myself had a lively conversation about what constitutes a public stack and presented it. Core principles: individual ownership/control and convenience. A main challenge is protecting personhood in the digital age. Personhood is a prerequisite to the social contract. Individual sovereignty is a necessary (but not sufficient) prerequisite for a healthy commons.

  Other teams raised points including: keeping values at the core of the stack (see [Ethical Design Manifesto](https://ind.ie/ethical-design)), ethics in sourcing and manufacture (see [Fairphone](https://fairphone.org)).
