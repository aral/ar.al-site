“Today, we are all cyborgs. This is not to say that we implant ourselves with technology but that we extend our biological capabilities using technology. We are sharded beings; with parts of our selves spread across and augmented by our everyday things.” – [The Nature of the Self in the Digital Age](https://ar.al/notes/the-nature-of-the-self-in-the-digital-age/)

[Louisa Treichmann](https://www.wdka.nl/stories/its-yours-louisa) is preparing an exhibition titled [Digital Masquerade](http://waag.org/en/event/digital-masquerade) as part of the Manifesting Futures series. The event will take place next week in the Theatrum Anatomicum at De Waag. Today, I had the pleasure of chatting at length with Louisa on the topic of identity and to record a direct-to-camera piece on the cyborg nature of the self that will be projected on the wall during the event.
