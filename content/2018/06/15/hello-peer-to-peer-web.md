While documenting my [deep dive into multiwriter hyperdb](https://forum.ind.ie/t/deep-dive-into-multiwriter-hyperdb/2184), I realised I was doing so on our forums, running Discourse, when I’d just demonstrated the day before [how you can live blog on the peer-to-peer Web](https://forum.ind.ie/t/deep-dive-into-multiwriter-hyperdb/2184/1).

So I went on [a little tangent](https://mastodon.ar.al/@aral/100207852262520843) and set up this “live” blog. Live as in, every time I save what I’m doing, the changes get pushed out to anyone viewing the site with live reload turned on in [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com'). If you’re viewing the site on a regular web browser, you’ll just see a regular site and you won’t get the streaming updates. It’s an example of how we can progressively enhance the centralised web with the peer-to-peer web using the [DAT protocol](https://datproject.org).
