I just released [Indie Web Server](/2019/03/14/introducing-indie-web-server-video/) version 6.3.0 with nicer default 404 and 500 error pages and support for custom ones.

{{<figure src="custom-500.png" alt="A pink monster with tears welling up in its eyes. The text reads: â€œSniffâ€¦ There was a server error: Bad things have happened." caption="A custom 500 message. Poor little baby monster is really taking it badly.">}}

To create a custom error page for your static site, just create a folder at `/404` or `/500` in your web content and add, at a minimum, an `index.html` file in it.

Any assets you put in those folders can be addressed using standard relative links from the `index.html` file.

Your error pages will be served at the URL of the error itself and using the correct error codes (not, for example, using redirects).

I also added a tiny bit of life to the default error pages.

Enjoy! :)
