In GNOME, you can only set one key binding for a given action using the Settings app (under Devices â†’ Keyboard) even though the settings data structure itself accepts an array.

You can, however, set multiple key bindings per action by installing the dconf Editor app or through the command-line using the `gsettings` command.

To install dconf Editor:

{{<highlight sh>}}
sudo apt install dconf-editor
{{</highlight>}}

To change key bindings via the command-line (e.g. for switching the windows of an application):

{{<highlight sh>}}
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-group "['<Alt>Above_Tab', '<Super>Above_Tab']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-group-backward "['<Shift><Alt>Above_Tab', '<Shift><Super>Above_Tab']"
{{</highlight>}}
