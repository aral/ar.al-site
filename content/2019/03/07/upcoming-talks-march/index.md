I’m giving two talks this month; at [Le Grand Barouf Numérique](https://www.legrandbarouf.fr/) in Lille, France on the 20th and at the [Art, Technology, and Change conference](https://cphdox.dk/en/art-technology-change-2019/) at [CPH:DOX](https://cphdox.dk/en/), the Copenhagen International Documentary Film Festival in Copenhagen, Denmark on the 26th.

The body text is the same as the opening paragraph of my Small Tech post that’s linked to in the body of the page." caption="The Antidote to Big Tech (is Small Tech) – my session description at CPH:DOX.">}}

At both events, I will be talking about how the bridge from [surveillance capitalism](https://2018.ar.al/notes/the-nature-of-the-self-in-the-digital-age/) to [peerocracy](https://peertube.fr/videos/watch/3875e4f2-500d-4c21-94f6-0692a67b87f1) will be paved by [Small Technology](https://ar.al/2019/03/04/small-technology/) and [the peer web](https://ar.al/2019/02/13/on-the-general-architecture-of-the-peer-web/).
