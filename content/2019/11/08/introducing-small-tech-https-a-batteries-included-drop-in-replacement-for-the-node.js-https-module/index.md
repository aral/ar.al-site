Today‚Äôs my birthday so I thought I‚Äôd give you a little present: [`@small-tech/https`](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/lib/https/).

## Plug-and-play https

This is essentially a drop-in, batteries-included version of [the Node.js `https` module](https://nodejs.org/api/all.html#https_https) that:

  - __Automatically provisions locally-trusted TLS certificates for localhost__ for development use (courtesy of [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) seamlessly integrated via [Nodecert](https://source.ind.ie/hypha/tools/nodecert)).

  - __Automatically provisions globally-trusted TLS certificates for your domain(s)__ for cross-browser testing, staging, and production courtesy of [Let‚Äôs Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

## Install

```sh
npm i @small-tech/https
```

## Example

Here‚Äôs a basic HTTPS server that responds to every `GET` request with a simple ‚Äúhello, world‚Äù page.

1. ### Set up

    ```sh
    # Create the project folder and switch to it.
    mkdir example && cd example

    # Create a new npm module for the example.
    npm init --yes

    # Install dependencies.
    npm i @small-tech/https

    # Open up the main file in your default editor.
    $EDITOR index.js
    ```

2. ### Code (index.js)

    ```javascript
    const https = require('@small-tech/https')

    // Helpers
    function html(message) {
      return `<!doctype html><html lang='en'><head><meta charset='utf-8'/><title>Hello, world!</title><style>body{background-color: white; font-family: sans-serif;}</style></head><body><h1>${message}</h1></body></html>`
    }
    const headers = {'Content-Type': 'text/html'}

    let options = {}

    // For globally-trusted Let‚Äôs Encrypt certificates uncomment options.
    // To provision certificates, also remove ‚Äústaging: true‚Äù property.

    // options = {
    //   domain: 'hostname',
    //   staging: true
    // }

    // Default (no options): create HTTPS server at https://localhost
    // with locally-trusted certificates.
    const server = https.createServer(options, (request, response) => {
      // Respond to all routes with the same page.
      response.writeHead(200, headers)
      response.end(html('Hello, world!'))
    })

    server.listen(443, () => {
      console.log(' üéâ Server running on port 443.')
    })
    ```

3. ### Run

    ```sh
    node index
    ```

Hit `https://localhost` and you should see your site served with locally-trusted TLS certificates.

## Let‚Äôs encrypt!

To provision globally-trusted Let‚Äôs Encrypt certificates instead, just uncomment the `options` object. Test it out with the `staging` flag set to true first and, once you verify that certificates are being properly generated, remove the flag to actually provision the certificates the first time your server is hit.

## TL; DT

Too long, didn‚Äôt type?

You can find a version of this example in the `/example` folder. To download and run it:

```sh
# Clone this repository.
git clone https://source.ind.ie/site.js/lib/https.git

# Switch to the directory.
cd https

# Install dependencies.
npm i

# Run the example.
npm run example
```

## Happy birthday to you!

I hope you enjoy my little birthday present and I hope that it makes your life easier.
