## We need to talk about Site.js

This weekend, I released [Site.js](https://sitejs.org) version 12.7.0 with improvements to [its WebSocket interface](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md#websocket-wss-routes). Today, I want to take you step-by-step into building and running a basic chat app using Site.js.

It‚Äôs much easier than you think, so fire up a terminal window, grab your code editor, and let‚Äôs get started!

  1. ## Install Site.js

      If you don‚Äôt already have Site.js, you first need to install it.

      {{< install_site_js >}}

      The download and installation should take about 10-15 seconds depending on the speed of your Internet connection.

      Unless otherwise stated, the remaining instructions should work verbatim across Linux, macOS, and Windows 10.

  2. ## Test it

    In your terminal[^1], create a simple static ‚ÄúHello, world!‚Äù web page and serve it:

    ```shell
    # Create a folder to work in and switch to it.
    mkdir demo
    cd demo

    # Create the simplest possible ‚Äúweb page‚Äù.
    echo 'Hello, world' > index.html

    # Run Site.js to serve the site.
    site
    ```

    To test that it‚Äôs working, fire up your browser of choice and visit `https://localhost`

    {{< browser location="https://localhost/" caption="A very simple static page.">}}
    <p>Hello, world!</p>
    {{< /browser >}}

    A couple of things to note:

    ### You didn‚Äôt have to configure anything, it just worked.

    Site.js is zero-configuration. It favours intelligent defaults over silly ones that leave you to do all the work.

    ### You didn‚Äôt get a certificate warning in the browser.

    Site.js uses the excellent [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) tool to seamlessly create a certificate authority on your local machine and issue you a valid TLS certificate the first time you run a server at localhost.[^2]

    ### You have access to very basic, ephemeral statistics.

    If you look at the terminal window, you will see an address you can hit in your browser to see basic statistics about your site.

    {{< terminal title="~/demo" caption="Your statistics URL is cryptographically secure." >}}üìä For statistics, see https://localhost/909b721d634e89c44754cc036fb379e1{{</ terminal >}}

    This is [a cryptographically secure address](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/lib/Stats.js#L48) that others cannot guess. So your statistics are initially private. If you want to share them with the world, just share the URL.

    Also, these statistics are not stored anywhere and will reset when you restart the server (but your statistics URL will stay the same). They are there for you to discover how your site is being used so you can improve it and to see if there are any errors like missing pages, not to let you spy on people.

    Once you‚Äôre done testing your shiny new site, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd> to stop the Site.js server.

  3. ## Cha-cha-cha changes!

    Static sites are all well and good but you were promised a chat app and you can‚Äôt build that with a fully static site. So let‚Äôs take a quick look at how we can create dynamic apps with Site.js.

    I mentioned earlier that Site.js is zero-configuration. This means that it has certain conventions that it expects you to adhere to. For example, if you want to create dynamic routes in your web app, you must place them in a folder called `.dynamic`.

    Before we move onto creating the chat functionality, let‚Äôs create the equivalent of our static ‚Äúhello, world!‚Äù example but with some very basic dynamic functionality to display the current date and time.

    ### A timely example

    First, create a folder called `.dynamic` within your `demo` folder:

    ```shell
    mkdir .dynamic
    ```

    Next, open your code editor of choice and create a file called `date.js` in the `.dynamic` folder. Once you‚Äôre done, your project folder hierarchy should look like this:

    <div class='directory-hierarchy'>
    {{< highlight shell >}}demo/
  ‚îú .index.html    # static route
  ‚îî .dynamic
        ‚îî date.js  # dynamic route{{</ highlight >}}
    </div>

    In the `date.js` file, enter the following code:

    ```javascript
    module.exports = (request, response) => {
      const now = new Date().toString()
      response
        .type('html')
        .end(now)
    }
    ```

    Finally, run the `site` command in the `demo` folder and visit `https://localhost/date`.

    {{< browser location="https://localhost/date" caption="A dynamic DotJS route. Refresh the page to see it update." >}}
    <p><script>document.write(new Date().toString())</script></p>
    {{< /browser >}}

    You should see the current date.

    Refresh and you should see the date update. Congratulations, you just created your first dynamic web site using Site.js.

    (Seriously.)

    ### What magic is this?

    I call it [DotJS](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md#dotjs).

    DotJS maps JavaScript modules defined in `.js` files (see what I did there?) to web routes on your web site in a manner that will be familiar to anyone who has ever used PHP.

    In our example, DotJS knows that we want the file defined at `.dynamic/date.js` to be served at the address `https://localhost/date`.
    
    If we‚Äôd wanted our dynamic page to be available from `https://localhost/date-and-time` instead, we would have defined our route in `.dynamic/date-and-time.js`.[^3]

    Using DotJS, all you have to do is write the logic for your web app. Everything else, including creating a secure HTTPS and WebSocket server for you and registering your routes, etc., is handled for you by Site.js.

    Furthermore, there is no magic here. Under the hood, these are simply plain old tried-and-tested [Express](https://expressjs.com/) routes.[^4] Site.js contains [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) so you can do anything in your dynamic routes that you can do with Node.js ‚Äì including [using node modules](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md#using-node-modules) ‚Äì without installing Node.js.

    When you‚Äôre ready to move on, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd> to stop the Site.js server.

  4. ## Did someone mention a chat app?

    OK, OK, I know I‚Äôm taking the scenic route but I wanted to introduce you to the basic concepts of Site.js before getting to the chat app so you have a solid foundation to build on.

    Site.js, as you might have guessed, is not limited to HTTPS routes. You can also create secure WebSocket routes. And you can use DotJS with WebSockets also.

    Let‚Äôs start by creating and testing the back-end of the chat app and when we‚Äôre happy with it, we can cobble together a basic web interface for it.

    ### The chat server

    In your `demo/.dynamic` folder, create a new folder called `.wss`. This is the folder Site.js expects you to place WebSocket routes in.

    Then, in your `.wss` folder, create a file called `chat.js`.

    When you‚Äôre done, your directory structure should look like this:

    <div class='directory-hierarchy'>
    {{< highlight shell >}}demo/
  ‚îú .index.html
  ‚îî .dynamic
        ‚îú date.js
        ‚îî .wss
            ‚îî chat.js{{</ highlight >}}
    </div>

    Now type the following code into that file:

    ```js
    module.exports = function (client, request) {
      client.room = this.setRoom(request)
      console.log(`New client connected to ${client.room}`)
    }
    ```

    The function you just wrote will be called any time a new client connects to our chat server at the `/chat` path (which will be available locally at `wss://localhost/chat`)[^5]. In chat app parlance, what we‚Äôve created is known as a ‚Äúroom.‚Äù So let‚Äôs try and join it and see what happens.

    ### Room for improvement

    To test our new room, run `site` in your `demo` folder and, once the server is running, open up a JavaScript console in your browser of choice and enter the following code:

    ```js
    socket = new WebSocket('wss://localhost/chat')
    ```

    Now look in your terminal, you should see:

    {{< terminal title="~/demo" caption="We‚Äôve connected‚Ä¶ now what?">}}New client connected to /chat{{</ terminal >}}

    So we‚Äôve just made a successful connection to the `/chat` room. Now we need the server to listen for messages sent from connected clients and broadcast them to every other client in the same room.

    ### Broadly speaking

    Modify the code in `chat.js` so that it matches the listing below:

    ```js
    module.exports = function (client, request) {
      client.room = this.setRoom(request)
      console.log(`New client connected to ${client.room}`)

      client.on('message', message => {
        this.broadcast(client, message)
      })
    }
    ```

    What we‚Äôre doing here is creating an event handler that listens for `message` events and then uses the `broadcast` method that all DotJS WebSocket routes have to fan the message out to the other clients connected to the same room.

    An important thing to note is that you should always use an `function` expression instead of an arrow function expression when creating your WebSocket routes to ensure that you can access methods like `broadcast()` using the `this` reference[^6].

  5.  ## Can you hear me now?

    Our chat server is complete but does it work? Let‚Äôs return to our JavaScript console and test it. This time, open two browser windows and let‚Äôs try and hold a conversation.

    In the JavaScript console of the first browser window, enter:

    ```js
    socket = new WebSocket('wss://localhost/chat')
    socket.onmessage = message => console.log(message.data)
    ```

    In the JavaScript console of the second browser window, enter:

    ```js
    socket = new WebSocket('wss://localhost/chat')
    socket.onmessage = message => console.log(message.data)
    socket.send('Can you hear me now?')
    ```

    Glance at the JavaScript console of the first browser window and you should see the message you just sent appear. You can reply from the first window using the same `socket.send()` method as before.

    Functionally, our chat server is complete but let‚Äôs modify the code one last time just to add some logging and to document our work to make it easier to remember what we‚Äôre doing.

    Before we move on, replace the code in `chat.js` with the following listing:

    ```js
    module.exports = function (client, request) {
      // New client connection: persist client‚Äôs ‚Äúroom‚Äù
      // based on request path.
      client.room = this.setRoom(request)

      // Log the connection.
      console.log(`New client connected to ${client.room}`)

      client.on('message', message => {
        // New message received: broadcast it to all
        // other clients in the same room.
        const numberOfRecipients = this.broadcast(client, message)

        // Log the number of recipients message was sent to
        // and make sure we pluralise the log message properly.
        console.log(`${client.room} message broadcast to `
          + `${numberOfRecipients} recipient`
          + `${numberOfRecipients === 1 ? '' : 's'}`)
      })
    }
    ```

  6. ## Some housekeeping

    If you remember, towards the start of this tutorial we created a dynamic HTTPS route that shows the current date and time. With Site.js serving the `demo` folder, try to access the `/date` route now.

    {{< browser location="https://localhost/date" caption="We don‚Äôt talk about my emoji problem‚Ä¶" >}}
    <div id='not-found-error'>
      <h1>4ü§≠4</h1>
      <p>Could not find <span class='not-found-path'>/date</span></p>
    </div>
    {{</ browser >}}

    Oops, you get the default Site.js 404 page[^7].

    Site.js can‚Äôt file the file. Why?

    Turns out ever since we created the `.wss` folder, Site.js has been ignoring our `.dynamic/date.js` route due to [routing precedence](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md#routing-precedence) rules.

    That‚Äôs a fancy way of saying that if we want to use HTTPS and WebSocket DotJS routes together in the same web app, we must put our HTTPS routes in a folder called `.https` just like we put the WebSocket routes in a folder called `.wss`.

    So create a folder called `.https` inside the `.dynamic` folder and move the `date.js` file into it.

    When you‚Äôre done, your directory structure should look like this:

    <div class='directory-hierarchy'>
    {{< highlight shell >}}demo/
  ‚îú .index.html
  ‚îî .dynamic
        ‚îú .https
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî date.js
        ‚îî .wss
            ‚îî chat.js{{< /highlight >}}
    </div>

    Restart your Site.js server and hit `https://localhost/date`.

    The route should now load correctly.

    If you look at your terminal output, you will see that Site.js tells you exactly which routes it loads when it launches:

    {{< terminal title="~/demo" caption="The console output from Site.js contains important details." >}}üêÅ Found .https/.wss folders. Will load dynamic routes from there.
üêÅ Adding HTTPS GET route: /date
üêÅ Adding WebSocket (WSS) route: /chat{{</ terminal >}}

  7. ## Room with a view

    So our chat server works but it doesn‚Äôt have a web interface yet.

    Let‚Äôs fix that!

    Open up the static `index.html` we created in the very first exercise with the ‚ÄúHello, world!‚Äù message in it and replace the contents of that file with the following:

    ```html
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>Basic chat app with Site.js</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Chat room</h1>
      <!-- Code from the next step goes here. -->
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    With Site.js serving the `demo` folder, hit `https://localhost` in your browser and confirm that you see it say ‚ÄúChat room‚Äù.

    ### Create the interface

    Our simple web interface is going to contain three main components: a connection status widget to show you whether you are connected to the server or not, a message form where you can identify yourself, compose messages, and send them, and, finally, a message display area where we can display both your sent messages and any incoming messages received from others.

    Add the interface components to your web page by pasting the code below under the heading in the body of your page.

    ```html
    <p>Status: <span id='status' style="color: red;">Offline</span></p>
    <form id='message-form'>
      <label for='nickname'>Nickname:</label>
      <input id='nickname' name='nickname' value='Anonymous'>
      <label for='message'>Message:</label>
      <input id='message' name='message' value=''>
      <button id='send-button' type='submit'>Send</button>
    </form>
    <h2>Messages</h2>
    <ul id='messages'></ul>
    ```

    Let‚Äôs also add some very basic styling to make our app a little easier on the eyes. Just before the end of the `head` tag, add a `style` tag: 

    ```html
    <style>
      /* Code from the next step goes here. */
    </style>
    ```

    First, let‚Äôs style the major elements. Add the following to your `style` tag:

    ```css
      /* Make CSS behave (as much as that‚Äôs possible) ;) */
      * { box-sizing: border-box; }

      body {
        font-family: sans-serif;
        padding: 1em;
      }

      h1 { margin-top: 0; }
    ```

    Next, let‚Äôs style the form to make it display in a responsive two-column layout:

    ```css
      form {
        background: #eee;
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: [labels] auto [controls] 1fr;
        align-items: center;
        grid-row-gap: 0.5em;
        grid-column-gap: 0.5em;
        padding: 0.75em;
      }

      form > label { grid-column: labels; }

      form > input, form > button {
        grid-column: controls;
        min-width: 6em;
        max-width: 300px;
        padding: 0.5em;
        font-size: 1em;
      }
    ```

    Let‚Äôs also style the button so that it‚Äôs green when enabled, gray when disabled, and transitions smoothly between those states:

    ```css
      button {
        text-align: center;
        cursor: pointer;
        font-size:16px;
        color: white;
        border-radius: 4px;
        background-color:#466B6A;
        border: none;
        padding: 0.75em;
        padding-top: 0.25em;
        padding-bottom: 0.25em;
        transition: color 0.5s;
        transition: background-color 0.5s;
      }

      button:hover {
        color: black;
        background-color: #92AAA4;
      }

      button:disabled {
        color: #999;
        background-color: #ccc;
      }
    ```

    Finally, let‚Äôs hide the bullet points and add a background to the message list. We also want to give it a definite height so that it scrolls instead of growing forever:

    ```css
    #messages {
      height: 10em;
      overflow-y: scroll;
      background-color: #eee;
      padding: 0.75em;
      list-style: none;
    }
    ```

    Now, when you visit `https://localhost` in your browser, you should see that your (currently non-functional) chat interface resembles the one below:

    {{< browser location="https://localhost" caption="The web interface (non-functional)." >}}
    <div class='chat-interface'>
      <h1>Chat room</h1>
      <p>Status: <span id='non-functional-status' style="color: red;">Offline</span></p>
      <!-- Note: added code to prevent send button from reloading the tutorial -->
      <form id='non-functional-message-form' onsubmit='return false'>
        <label for='nickname'>Nickname:</label>
        <input id='nickname' type='text' name='nickname' value='Anonymous'>
        <label for='message'>Message:</label>
        <input id='message' type='text' name='message' value=''>
        <button id='send-button' type='submit'>Send</button>
      </form>
      <h2>Messages</h2>
      <ul class='messages' id='non-functional-messages'></ul>
    </div>
    {{< /browser >}}

    ### Make the connection

    OK, so let‚Äôs add some life to our room, shall we?

    Under your interface code, add a `script` tag and let‚Äôs get our status indicator working by making a WebSocket connection to our server, listening for the relevant events, and updating the interface accordingly:

    ```js
    <script>
      // Shorthand for basic DOM lookup via CSS selectors.
      const element = document.querySelector.bind(document)

      // Initialise web socket.
      const socket = new WebSocket(
        `wss://${window.location.hostname}/chat`
      )

      // Display the state of the connection.
      socket.onopen = _ => {
        element('#status').innerHTML = '<span style="color: green">Online</span>'
      }

      socket.onclose = _ => {
        element('#status').innerHTML = 'Offline'
      }

      // Code from the next step goes here.

    </script>
    ```

    Restart the Site.js server[^8] and you should now see the status indicator read <span style="color: green">Online</span> when you reload the page:

    {{< browser location="https://localhost" caption="Live example, connected to wss://ar.al/chat.">}}
    <div class='chat-interface'>
      <h1>Chat room</h1>
      <p>Status: <span id='connection-only-status' style="color: red;">Offline</span></p>
      <!-- Note: added code to prevent send button from reloading the tutorial -->
      <form id='connection-only-message-form' onsubmit='return false'>
        <label for='connection-only-nickname'>Nickname:</label>
        <input id='connection-only-nickname' type='text' name='nickname' value='Anonymous'>
        <label for='connection-only-message'>Message:</label>
        <input id='connection-only-message' type='text' name='message' value=''>
        <button id='connection-only-send-button' type='submit'>Send</button>
      </form>
      <h2>Messages</h2>
      <ul class='messages' id='messages'></ul>
    </div>
    <script>
      // Initialise web socket.
      const connectionOnlySocket = new WebSocket(
        `wss://${window.location.hostname}/chat`
      )

      // Display the state of the connection.
      connectionOnlySocket.onopen = _ => {
        element('#connection-only-status').innerHTML = '<span style="color: green">Online</span>'
      }

      connectionOnlySocket.onclose = _ => {
        element('#connection-only-status').innerHTML = 'Offline'
      }
    </script>
    {{< /browser >}}

    Note that when making the WebSocket connection, we didn‚Äôt hardcode the URL like before. Instead, we used:

    ```js
    new WebSocket(`wss://${window.location.hostname}/chat`)
    ```

    This ensures that the app will work regardless of which domain it is served from.

    During development, `windows.location.hostname` will resolve to `localhost`, as before. When running in production ‚Äì as it is here on my blog ‚Äì it will resolve to the domain name of the site[^9].

    ### Handle message sending

    Now that our app can connect to the chat server and display its connection status, let‚Äôs implement the ability to send messages.

    When we send a message, we won‚Äôt receive it back ourselves, so one of the things we must do is to add it to our local message list manually. Since we‚Äôll also have to do this when we receive a message from someone else, let‚Äôs first create a function we can use for both these purposes:

    ```js
    // Helper: display a message object.
    function displayMessage (message) {
        // Prepare the message HTML.
        const nickname = `<strong>${message.nickname}:</strong>`
        const text = message.text
        const messageHTML = `<li>${nickname} ${text}</li>`

        // Update the message list.
        element('#messages').innerHTML += messageHTML
    }
    ```

    Next, let‚Äôs create the handler that will be called when your message form is submitted by pressing the <button onclick='return false'>Send</button> button:

    ```js
    // Handle message sending.
    element('#message-form').addEventListener('submit', event => {
      // Prevent the form from being submitted.
      event.preventDefault()

      // Get the nickname and text.
      const nickname = element('#nickname').value
      const text = element('#message').value

      // Clear the message
      element('#message').value = ''

      // Create a message object, serialise it as JSON, and send it.
      const message = { nickname, text }
      socket.send(JSON.stringify(message))

      // Update the local display
      displayMessage(message)
    })

    // Code from the next step goes here.

    ```

    In our handler, we construct a message object that contains your nickname and the text of the message you want to send, serialise it into a JSON-formatted string, and then send it to our chat server.

    Additionally, we clear the message box to make it easier for you to type your next message and we use our new `displayMesssage()` function to display the message we‚Äôve sent locally so you can have a full timeline of messages, including your own.

    Restart your Site.js server and reload the page and you should now we able to send messages. To test that it is working, take a look at the Site.js console output in your terminal window and you should see the following message:

    {{< terminal title="~/demo" caption="A message to no one." >}}/chat message broadcast to 0 recipients{{</ terminal >}}

    So our message is being sent but no one is receiving it. This makes sense since the `broadcast()` method in our chat server does not send a copy of the message to the client it received it from and we don‚Äôt have any other clients connected.

    Now open up a second browser window and load a copy of `https://localhost` in it and try sending another message.

    This time, you should see the following console output in your terminal:

    {{< terminal title="~/demo" caption="A message to someone." >}}/chat message broadcast to 1 recipient{{</ terminal >}}

    Well that‚Äôs progress. So our messages are being broadcast successfully but we‚Äôre not doing anything to process them on the web interface yet. Let‚Äôs implement that next.

    ### Handle incoming messages

    When a message is received on the socket, the `onmessage` event handler is invoked. Add the following code to the end of your `script` tag to define a message handler that parses the received JSON string (remember, we serialise message objects in JSON format before sending them) and add it to the unordered list in our interface:

    ```js
    // Handle incoming messages.
    socket.onmessage = message => {
      // Deserialise the message string and display it.
      message = JSON.parse(message.data)
      displayMessage(message)
    }
    ```

    Now when you test your app using two browser windows, you should be able to both send and receive messages.

    You can test out what we have so far using the two browser windows below. They‚Äôre both running the code above:

    <!-- First chat window -->

    <div id='first-chat-window'>
    {{< browser location="https://localhost" caption="First chat window.">}}
    <div class='chat-interface'>
      <h1>Chat room</h1>
      <p>Status: <span id='first-chat-window-status' style="color: red;">Offline</span></p>
      <!-- Note: added code to prevent send button from reloading the tutorial -->

      const firstChatWindowSocket = new WebSocket(
        `wss://${window.location.hostname}/chat`
      )

      // Display the state of the connection.
      firstChatWindowSocket.onopen = _ => {
        element('#first-chat-window-status').innerHTML = '<span style="color: green">Online</span>'
      }

      firstChatWindowSocket.onclose = _ => {
        element('#first-chat-window-status').innerHTML = 'Offline'
      }

      function firstChatWindowDisplayMessage (message) {
        element('#first-chat-window-messages').innerHTML += `<li><strong>${message.nickname}: </strong>${message.text}</li>`
      }

      // Handle message sending.
      element('#first-chat-window-message-form').addEventListener('submit', event => {
        // Prevent the form from being submitted.
        event.preventDefault()

        // Get the nickname and text.
        const nickname = element('#first-chat-window-nickname').value
        const text = element('#first-chat-window-message').value

        // Clear the message
        element('#first-chat-window-message').value = ''

        // Create a message object, serialise it as JSON, and send it.
        const message = { nickname, text }
        firstChatWindowSocket.send(JSON.stringify(message))

        // Update the local display
        firstChatWindowDisplayMessage(message)
      })

      // Handle incoming messages.
      firstChatWindowSocket.onmessage = message => {
        // Deserialise the message string.
        message = JSON.parse(message.data)

        // Display the message in the messages list.
        firstChatWindowDisplayMessage(message)
      }
    </script>
    {{< /browser >}}

        event.preventDefault()

        // Get the nickname and text.
        const nickname = element('#second-chat-window-nickname').value
        const text = element('#second-chat-window-message').value

        message = JSON.parse(message.data)

        // Display the message in the messages list.
        secondChatWindowDisplayMessage(message)
      }
    </script>
    {{< /browser >}}
    </div>

  8. ## Spit and shine

    So our chat room works but it‚Äôs not as elegant as it could be. Without going overboard (this is a basic tutorial, after all), there are a couple of little touches we can add that would improve its usability considerably.

    ### Set initial focus (‚Äúdon‚Äôt make me click‚Äù)

    To start, when the app first loads, the first thing the person will most likely want to do is replace _Anonymous_ with their own nickname. So let‚Äôs make it easier for them by focusing that field and selecting the text in it so all they have to do to get started is to start typing their nickname.

    Right after the definition of the `displayMessage()` function, add the following code:

    ```js
    element('#nickname').focus()
    element('#nickname').select()
    ```

    ### Manage focus

    While on the topic of focus, if the person types a message and presses <kbd>Return</kbd> to send it, the message text field maintains its focus. This is good as it means that they can send another message without doing any more work. However, if they use the <button onclick='return false'>Send</button> button to send the message, the message text field loses focus. So it‚Äôs up to us to set its focus manually.

    Under the `element('#message').value = ''` line in the form `submit` event handler, let‚Äôs set the focus after we‚Äôve cleared the field:

    ```js
    element('#message').focus()
    ```

    ### Auto-scroll the messages list

    If you send more messages than will fit in the message list, the latest messages scroll off the screen.

    <div id='auto-scroll'>
    {{< browser location="https://ar.al/2019/10/04/build-a-simple-chat-app-with-site.js/#first-chat-window" caption="Lack of auto scroll means we miss the punchline of the joke (and our species is going to be the punchline of the joke if we don‚Äôt get our act together)." >}}
    <div class='chat-interface'>
    <h2>Messages</h2>
    <ul class="messages">
      <li><strong>Aral: </strong>Hey, so I have a joke for you‚Ä¶</li>
      <li><strong>Laura: </strong>Oh, yeah?</li>
      <li><strong>Aral: </strong>Knock, knock!</li>
      <li><strong>Laura: </strong>Who‚Äôs there?</li>
      <li><strong>Aral: </strong>Endangered species</li>
      <li><strong>Laura: </strong>Endangered species, who?</li>
      <li><strong>Aral: </strong><em>*silence due to extinction of species between delivery of lines*</em></li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    {{</ browser >}}
    </div>

    This is less than ideal.

    Instead, we want the message list to automatically scroll to the end every time a new message arrives so that you can read it without additional effort.

    That‚Äôs easy enough to achieve by replacing the `displayMessage()` function we wrote earlier with the following one. The line of code that does all the work is highlighted, below:

    <div id='display-message-update'>
    {{< highlight js >}}
    function displayMessage (message) {
      // Prepare the message HTML.
      const nickname = `<strong>${message.nickname}:</strong>`
      const text = message.text
      const messageHTML = `<li>${nickname} ${text}</li>`

      // Update the message list.
      const messageList = element('#messages')
      messageList.innerHTML += messageHTML{{</ highlight >}}<div class='emphasised'>{{< highlight js >}}
      messageList.scrollTop = messageList.scrollHeight{{</ highlight >}}</div>{{< highlight js >}}
    }{{</ highlight >}}
    </div>

    ### Client-side validation

    Things are feeling a bit nicer now but the elephant in the room (his name is George!) is that we‚Äôre not performing any input validation. Someone could easily submit a message with no nickname and no message text and we would dutifully fan it out to the other people in the room leading to undue heartache and pain.

    Try it out for yourself using [the live example](#first-chat-window), above.

    Let‚Äôs fix this by adding a `validateForm()` function we can call to ensure that the form is valid. When the form‚Äôs not valid, we‚Äôll disable the <button onclick='return false'>Send</button> button:

    ```js
    // Is the passed object a valid string?
    function isValidString(s) {
      return Boolean(s)                // Isn‚Äôt null, undefined, '', or 0
        && typeof s === 'string'       // and is the correct type
        && s.replace(/\s/g, '') !== '' // and is not just whitespace.
    }

    // Disables the Send button if the form isn‚Äôt valid.
    function validateForm () {
      const nicknameIsValid = isValidString(element('#nickname').value)
      const messageIsValid = isValidString(element('#message').value)
      const formIsValid = nicknameIsValid && messageIsValid

      element('#send-button').disabled = !formIsValid
    }
    ```

    Now, we need to call our `validateForm()` function at certain times. First, we must call it when the page first loads so that the form is initially validated. Since there is no text in the message field, our interface will thus start out with the <button onclick='return false'>Send</button> button disabled. This is what we want.

    Next, we should validate the form after a message is sent. Why? Because we clear the old message field and so we want the <button onclick='return false'>Send</button> button to be disabled again.

    Finally, we must validate the form every time the text in the `nickname` and `message` text fields changes so that we can enable the <button onclick='return false'>Send</button> button when there‚Äôs text in both of them:

    ```js
    element('#nickname').addEventListener('input', validateForm)
    element('#message').addEventListener('input', validateForm)
    ```

    This is the bare minimum of validation that we can get away with. Here‚Äôs the final listing of the front-end code with the above improvements highlighted:

</div>

    ### Server-side validation

    We just implemented front-end validation but that‚Äôs only half the story.

    In a perfect world, everyone will use our lovely web page front-end and our front-end validation will catch all the issues, and no one will ever hit our back-end directly.

    In the real world, watch as I fire up a browser and send you an empty message using the JavaScript console of my browser and your chat server dutifully delivers it to everyone in the room:

    ```js
    // All your front-end validation are belong to us.
    socket = new WebSocket('wss://ar.al/chat')
    socket.send(JSON.stringify({nickname: '', text: ''}))
    ```

    Run the above code and check out [the live examples](#first-chat-window) above and you should see your empty message display there:

    <div id='server-side-validation-failure'>
    {{< browser location="https://ar.al/2019/10/04/build-a-simple-chat-app-with-site.js/#first-chat-window" >}}
    <div class='chat-interface'>
    <h2>Messages</h2>
    <ul class="messages">
      <li><strong>:</strong></li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    {{</ browser >}}
    </div>

    Oops! That‚Äôs not good.

    Front-end validation is a usability feature; back-end validation is a security feature.

    In a real-world chat app we would have to implement a host of features to prevent abuse (like rate limiting, blacklists, blocking, etc.). That‚Äôs outside the scope of this basic tutorial but let‚Äôs at least add some basic validation to our chat server.

    Add the following helper functions to the bottom of your chat server code:

    ```js
    // Is the passed object a valid string?
    function isValidString(s) {
      return Boolean(s)                // Isn‚Äôt null, undefined, '', or 0
        && typeof s === 'string'       // and is the correct type
        && s.replace(/\s/g, '') !== '' // and is not just whitespace.
    }

    // Is the passed message object valid?
    function isValidMessage(m) {
      return isValidString(m.nickname) && isValidString(m.text)
    }
    ```

    Then, at the top of the `message` handler, let‚Äôs call the `isValidMessage()` function with a parsed instance of the serialised message and abort broadcasting it if the message isn‚Äôt valid:

    ```js
    // Perform some basic validation.
    if (!isValidMessage(JSON.parse(message))) {
      console.log(`Message is invalid; not broadcasting.`)
      return
    }
    ```

    The live example at the very top of this tutorial connects to the final version of the chat server that contains our server-side validation.

    You can test that it works by running the following code from a JavaScript console in your browser and verifying that your message does not show up there:

    ```js
    // And I would have gotten away with it too,
    // if it weren't for you meddling kids‚Ä¶
    socket = new WebSocket('wss://ar.al/chat-final-version')
    socket.send(JSON.stringify({nickname: '', text: ''}))
    ```

    Here‚Äôs the final listing of the chat server, with this new feature highlighted:

    <div class='final-code-listing'>
    {{< highlight js >}}
module.exports = function (client, request) {
  // New client connection: persist client‚Äôs ‚Äúroom‚Äù
  // based on request path.
  client.room = this.setRoom(request)

  // Log the connection.
  console.log(`New client connected to ${client.room}`)

  client.on('message', message => {
{{</ highlight >}}<div class='emphasised'>{{< highlight js >}}
    // New message received: broadcast it to all other clients
    // in the same room after performing basic validation.
    if (!isValidMessage(JSON.parse(message))) {
      console.log(`Message is invalid; not broadcasting.`)
      return
    }

{{</ highlight >}}</div>{{< highlight js >}}
    const numberOfRecipients = this.broadcast(client, message)

    // Log the number of recipients message was sent to
    // and make sure we pluralise the log message properly.
    console.log(`${client.room} message broadcast to `
      + `${numberOfRecipients} recipient`
      + `${numberOfRecipients === 1 ? '' : 's'}`)
  })
}{{</ highlight >}}
    </div>

  9. ## Going further

    Well, you were promised a basic chat app in Site.js and that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôve just built. Along the way, you also learned the basics of Site.js and how to use it to develop and serve not just [WebSocket routes](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md#websocket-wss-routes) but [regular HTTPS routes](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md#get-only-simplest-approach) also using [DotJS](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md#dotjs).

    But that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what you can do with Site.js. As I mentioned during the tutorial, anything you can do with Node.js, you can do with Site.js. What you get in addition is a zero-configuration secure static and dynamic web server.

    So exactly what else can you do? Here are some ideas to explore on your own:

    ### Test your app from any device

    So far, you‚Äôve only run servers at `https://localhost` and, behind the scenes, Site.js ensured that you didn‚Äôt get certificate warnings when you did. But what if you want to test your chat app from your phone or to have others test it with you? You could, of course, deploy it to a public Virtual Private Server, which is the topic of [the next section](#deploy-to-production), but you can also run your server at your hostname using [the @hostname option](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md#testing-servers-hostname)[^10] and provide outside access to your development machine using a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/):

    ```shell
    # Start Site.js at your hostname instead of at localhost.
    site @hostname

    # (In a separate terminal tab/window, start ngrok)
    ngrok start --all
    ```

    Having done this, you can then hit `https://dev.my-domain.org` from any device anywhere and access your site from your development machine[^11]. And, again, Site.js will work to seamless provision Let‚Äôs Encrypt certificates for you so you will not get any certificate errors.

    ### Deploy to production

    All you need to deploy to production is a Virtual Private Server running a flavour of Linux that has systemd and has a domain name pointing to it.

    Once that‚Äôs set, if you ssh to your production server, you can install Site.js just like you did at the start of this tutorial and then, provided you‚Äôre in the directory that you want to serve, deploy a production server with the following command:

    ```shell
    site enable
    ```

    That will set up your server as a service that automatically restarts should it crash or should you reboot the server.

    And, just like before, Site.js will automatically provision your Let‚Äôs Encrypt certificates the first time you hit your site via your domain name. All you have to do ensure is that your `hostname` is set properly on your server.

    ### Sync

    So you have (a) your local copy of your site and you‚Äôve deployed (b) a live production server. How do you get your site from A to B?

    Simple!

    On Linux and macOS[^12], you can use Site.js‚Äôs `sync-to` command to deploy your site like so:

    ```shell
    site --sync-to=my-domain.org
    ```

    The above command will work with no other information necessary if the account name on your development machine and on your production machine is the same and you‚Äôre in your site‚Äôs directory. Otherwise, check the docs for on how to specify any details you need to.

    On your production server, to ensure that it supports sync, it‚Äôs a good idea to launch your server with the `--ensure-can-sync` option, which will install [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) ‚Äì the tool Site.js uses behind the scenes to sync your files ‚Äì if it doesn‚Äôt already exist.

    ### And there‚Äôs more‚Ä¶

    Check out [the Site.js documentation](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md) for some of the other nifty things you can do with Site.js like not breaking links and contributing to an [evergreen web](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md#native-support-for-an-evergreen-web) by taking advantage of Site.js‚Äôs native support for [cascading archives](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md#native-cascading-archives-support) and the [404-to-302 method](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md#native-404-302-support) as well as little niceties like [custom error pages](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md#custom-error-pages).

I hope this tutorial has whet your appetite for Site.js and given you some ideas of what you can do with it.

## Site.js and the single-tenant web

Remember that Site.js is a web tool for human beings, not startups or enterprises.

Site.js is for building single-tenant web sites and web apps.

### What is a single-tenant web app (or site?)

A single-tenant web app is a personal web app. It‚Äôs an app (or site) that you own and control. It‚Äôs a step towards building [a peer web](https://ar.al/2019/02/13/on-the-general-architecture-of-the-peer-web/).

That‚Äôs quite a radical concept for the web, which has so far been centralised.

We‚Äôre used to sites where you sign up for accounts with huge corporations. Turns out, when we do that, these corporations end up owning those accounts and they end up tracking and profiling us and attempting to influence our behaviour to make a quick buck (or billion).

When we examine [the social impacts of this toxic business model](https://ar.al/2019/05/02/slavery-2.0-and-how-to-avoid-it-a-practical-guide-for-cyborgs/), we find that they erode our personhood and threaten our democracies. (Wow, that escalated quickly!)

### Flipping the web upside down

</figure>

If we want to own and control the digital aspects of ourselves that form part of who we are as people, we must turn the web on its head. We must flip it upside down.

Ultimately, we must build [a web where each one of us has their own place](https://ar.al/2019/02/13/on-the-general-architecture-of-the-peer-web/)). That‚Äôs [what we‚Äôre working towards](https://small-tech.org/research-and-development/) at [Small Technology Foundation](https://small-tech.org) and Site.js is the foundations of our efforts.

I hope you find Site.js useful ‚Äì even if you don‚Äôt care about its philosophical or ethical underpinnings ‚Äì simply on the merits of what you, as a developer, can do with it and how easy it is to use.

<!-- Footnotes -->

[^1]: If you don‚Äôt want to use the terminal, you can open up your graphical file browser and create the `demo` folder using that and then use your graphical code editor to create an `index.html` file in that folder. You will, however, need to run the `site` command from a terminal session with its current working directory set to the `demo` folder‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no getting away from that.

[^2]: Site.js can also function as a proxy server, so you can test _any_ server locally over a secure connection. For example, if you are running a [Hugo](https://hugo.io) server at its default port (1313), you can test it from `https://localhost` by running Site.js like this:

    ```shell
    # Proxy the server at port 1313 at
    # https://localhost (port 443).
    site :1313
    ```

    Note that if you want live reload to work, you should add the `--liveReloadPort=443` option to your Hugo server command.

[^3]: DotJS‚Äôs auto routing does not limit you to a flat structure. In our example, we could also have placed our code in a file located at `.dynamic/date/time` which would have made it available at the address `https://localhost/date/time`.

[^4]: If you want full control over your routing, including the ability to use regular expressions in your route names and accessing global state, etc., you can do everything you can in Express using the [advanced routing](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md#advanced-routing-routesjs-file) feature by declaring a `routes.js` file in your `.dynamic` fodler.

[^5]: Note that the URL scheme is no longer `https` but `wss` since we‚Äôre talking about secure WebSocket routes now. If I had a penny for every time I wrote `https://` when I meant to write `wss://`‚Ä¶

[^6]: You might have noticed that we use an anonymous function expression in the `module.exports` line whereas we used an arrow function expression in the previous (HTTPS) examples and even though we use an arrow function expression to define the event handler. This is not by accident; it has to do with scope. If you want to have access to the `this` reference in your DotJS routes and access methods like `broadcast()`, you cannot use an arrow function expression to define your module, you must use the `function` keyword. Inside of your module, you are free to use arrow function expressions to your heart‚Äôs desire.

[^7]: You can easily [replace the default error pages with your own custom ones](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md#custom-error-pages). And as far as 404 errors go, you can reduce the number of them on the web in general and contribute towards [an evergreen web](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md#native-support-for-an-evergreen-web) by making use of the native [cascading archives](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md#native-cascading-archives-support) and [404-to-302](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/blob/master/README.md#native-404-302-support) support in Site.js.

[^8]: Site.js does not have LiveReload and does not automatically restart the server when dynamic routes change at the moment. When working with static content, this means that you have to manually refresh the browser and when working with dynamic content you have to manually restart the server whenever you make code changes. I realise this is less than ideal and both of these are high on [my list of issues](https://source.ind.ie/site.js/app/issues) to address.

[^9]: The examples on this page are live and connect to the instances of the app I have running at https://ar.al/chat (corresponding to the initial example, without server-side validation) and https://ar.al/chat-final-version. Needless to say, this site is served by Site.js.

[^10]: On Windows (because Windows), you have to add quotes around the `@hostname` option, so the command becomes `site "@hostname"`. Blame Bill Gates.

[^11]: To use ngrok with your own domain name, you will to subscribe for [a Pro account](https://ngrok.com/pricing) from ngrok (at least this is what Laura and I use at [Small Technology Foundation](https://small-tech.org)) and [set up a subdomain on your own domain name per their instructions](https://ngrok.com/docs#http-custom-domains).

[^12]: On Windows (because Windows), the sync function is not available as there‚Äôs currently no free and open rsync implementation that we can use like we can on Linux and macOS.
