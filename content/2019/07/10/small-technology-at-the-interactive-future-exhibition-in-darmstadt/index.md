I’m about to take off for Frankfurt via Zurich to talk about Small Technology at the [Interactive Future Exhibition](https://imd.mediencampus.h-da.de/if19/) in Darmstadt tomorrow. This is the graduation event of students on the Interactive Media Design programme at the [Hochschule Darmstady University of Applied Sciences](https://h-da.de/). It’s an honour to have been invited by the students to speak at their graduation event and I’m very much looking forward to seeing their projects and speaking with them.
