__2019/01/05: This is a Work In Progress (WIP).__ I will be live-updating this post as I work on the spike. If you want to get streaming updates without having to refresh your browser, [open the DAT version](dat://ar.al/2019/01/05/hypha-spike-deployment-1/) in [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/) and toggle the _live reloading_ feature. Please feel free to [talk to me about this](https://mastodon.ar.al/@aral) on the fediverse as I work on it, perhaps via [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org).
