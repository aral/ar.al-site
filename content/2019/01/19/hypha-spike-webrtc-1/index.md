__2019/01/19: This is a Work In Progress (WIP).__ I will be live-updating this post as I work on the spike. If you want to get streaming updates without having to refresh your browser, [open the DAT version](dat://ar.al/2019/01/19/hypha-spike-webrtc-1/) in [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/) and toggle the _live reloading_ feature. Please feel free to [talk to me about this](https://mastodon.ar.al/@aral) on the fediverse as I work on it, perhaps via [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org).

## Design

Following on from [Hypha Spike: DAT 1](../../15/hypha-spike-dat-1), this spike aims to explore:

  * Replicate a hypercore from browser-to-browser using WebRTC.

## Notes

### Iteration plan

1. Create a simple single-page web application that replicates a passed read key (equivalent to the native replication script)

## Postmortem

  * Spike is in progress.
