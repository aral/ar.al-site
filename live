# Start Hugo server.

# The baseURL and appendPort flags are set to overwrite the default behaviour
# of Hugo when run with the server option which is to write absolute URLs
# as localhost:<port> regardless of the setting of baseURL in the config.toml
# file. Since we do not have a separate build/deploy phase to the live server,
# we want the site as it would exist on the server to exist on the client.
#
# Note: if you do not want a post live-synced, mark it as draft: true in the
# ===== front matter.

# Donâ€™t exit. Shutting off this process should also kill
